Welcome to my bamazon, your one-stop shop for sporting goods and apparel. When a customer first arrives to my storefront they will be greeted by our inventory list along with a prompt asking them which item they would like to purchase, as seen below.

If the user enters an invalid id number, the app alerts them of it and asks them to re-enter an id number. If it is a valid id number the app will then ask about the quantity needed, as seen in the image below.

If there is sufficient quantity, the app will place the order and give the customer the cost of the purchase by multiplying the quantity and the price.

    If there is insufficient quantity to fulfill the order the app will notify the customer and ask them to modify their order. The app will then re-display the inventory.

After the completion of an order the app will update inventory by adjusting the quantities available. For example, we originally had 34 Nike Basketball Shorts available and so an order of 30 basketball shorts was successfully completed. However, when we attempted to duplicate the order the app notified the user of insufficient quantity as seen in the images below.
